You'll need a .env file setup for local variables. Heroku already has these set in production.

Log into your meetup account and setup a new app here http://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/oauth_consumers/
Also get your api key from http://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/key/

Here is an example file:

  export MEETUP_API_KEY=XXX
  export MEETUP_KEY=XXX
  export MEETUP_SECRET=XXX
  export MEETUP_GROUP=las-vegas-ruby-on-rails
